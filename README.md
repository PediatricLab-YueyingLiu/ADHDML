Here is my attempt at rewriting the To graduating peers:

Like petals carried on the spring breeze,
Our paths crossed for a precious moment.
Your youthful spirits, a fleeting delight,
Now a bittersweet memory to cherish.

Time's river flows ever onward,
Moments shared, forever etched within.
I wonder what joys could have blossomed,
Had fate granted us more time together.

Though our story remains unwritten,
I wish you the very best on your journey.
May your futures shine as brilliantly
As the promise of that fading spring.

Go forth, dear friends, with heads held high.
May your dreams take flight, your hearts soar.
The world awaits your boundless potential -
Seize this new dawn with courage and grace.
