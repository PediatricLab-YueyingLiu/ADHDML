Like petals carried on the spring breeze,
Our paths crossed briefly,
Your gentle smile, a fleeting joy,
Now just a bittersweet memory.

Time's river flows ever onward,
Moments lost, never to return.
I wonder what might have blossomed,
Had fortune granted us more time.

Though our story remains unwritten,
I wish you well on your journey.
May your future be as bright
As the promise of that fading spring.
